# Counter & Notifications App

This React application demonstrates two key concepts:

## ðŸ”¢ Counter Component
- **Auto-incrementing counter** that updates every second
- Uses `useEffect` with `setInterval` for automation
- **Proper cleanup** with `clearInterval` to prevent memory leaks
- Demonstrates React lifecycle management

## ðŸ”” Notifications Component  
- **Manual notifications** via button click
- **Automatic notifications** added every 5 seconds
- **Conditional rendering** to show notification count
- Uses function form of `setState` for reliable updates

## Key React Concepts Demonstrated
- âœ… `useState` hook for state management
- âœ… `useEffect` hook for side effects
- âœ… Proper cleanup functions to prevent memory leaks
- âœ… Function form of state setters: `setState(prev => prev + 1)`
- âœ… Conditional rendering with `&&` operator
- âœ… Event handling with `onClick`
